function tr_out = extrapolate_missing_frames4(tr_in)

% tr_in is a matrix with four columns:
%        x              y             f            id
%  (x-coordinate) (y-coordinate) (frame no.) (particle id no.)
% tr_in is sorted (by track.m) by particle id numbers and 
% within each particle by frame number. A few missing frames may be 
% allowed by track.m which will still consider the x-y data as 
% coordinates of the trajectory of the same particle.
